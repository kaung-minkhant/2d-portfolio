This is the log for building 2D portfolio.

This project will be written in typescript using vite. 

This project uses Kaboom as JS game engine.

Use terser minifier for vite, because Kaboom breaks with esbuild minifier

SliceX and SliceY will need to be calculated for spritesheet loading. This can be done by using the entire spritesheet dimensions and frame dimension.
